# G2 Ingegneria - Sistema Gestione Commesse

## Overview

G2 Ingegneria is a project management system designed for engineering firms to manage "commesse" (projects/jobs). The application provides a comprehensive dashboard for creating, organizing, and tracking engineering projects with intelligent file routing capabilities. It features a modern web interface with local data storage, AI-powered file organization suggestions, and support for different project templates (LUNGO and BREVE) based on project complexity.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript, using Vite for build tooling
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom G2 Ingegneria color scheme and theming
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js REST API
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **File Processing**: Local file system integration with File System Access API
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints for projects, clients, file routings, and system configuration

### Data Models
- **Projects**: Core entity with code, client, location, description, year, and template type
- **Clients**: Client registry with unique sigla (code) and project count tracking
- **File Routings**: AI-powered file organization suggestions with confidence scoring
- **System Config**: Application settings and configuration storage

### Local Storage Strategy
- **IndexedDB**: Primary storage for structured data (projects, clients, routings)
- **localStorage**: Configuration settings and user preferences
- **Dual Storage**: Memory-based development storage with interface for production database

### AI Integration
- **File Router**: Intelligent file placement suggestions using Claude AI API
- **Learning System**: Pattern recognition for improving routing accuracy over time
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-100 scale for routing suggestion reliability
- **Multiple Methods**: AI, rules-based, and learned pattern routing approaches

### Template System
- **LUNGO Template**: Comprehensive folder structure for complex engineering projects
- **BREVE Template**: Simplified structure for smaller projects
- **Dynamic Generation**: Template-based folder creation with customizable structures

### File System Integration
- **Browser API**: File System Access API for direct folder manipulation
- **Auto-Routing**: Intelligent file placement based on content analysis
- **Folder Structure**: Automated creation of project-specific directory hierarchies
